-   Make variables called:

    -   `number_of_dots` to store the number of dots 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 where each
        number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.
    -   `binary_cards` to store a set of strings "1, 2, 4, 8, 16," and displays it
        as the output.

-   Use the addition operator to combine two strings. You can use multiple addition
    blocks if you need to. Remember to check if the spaces are correct!
-   Use a for loop to run the lines inside a specified number of times. In this challenge
    you need to repeat the lines 5 times (4 times for the extra challenge).
