-   Make variables called `original_month` and `months_to_add` and set their values to the inputs entered by the user.
    Make a variable called `new_month` and set its value to the sum of the `original_month` and `months_to_add` modulo 12.
-   Make a list called `months` and add the 12 months; January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December to your list (list of length 12).
    Hint: you may want to start with December, and then go the normal order, since in Python item 0 of a list is the first month, and in this case if you get the answer 0, you need to produce 'December'.
